 - maps in dart like object in js 
 - sets like object but it just can has value with same type only. 

CHAPTER 5
 - null is not a value but it absense of a value
  refer null on dart documentation like how we can making any type nullable and cherry picking non-null values and null-aware assignment operator

CHAPTER 6 
 - enumaration is make sure that a value has a name that can be programmatically refer to. it also can described as a set of related constant. 
 - factory constructor : a way to construct an instance of class, if we wanna create instance of class multiple times in different places using the same name of constructor argument, so we need factory, please read docs

  custom operator
  hashcode 

CHAPTER 7 
 - extension : we use it if we belive that function that added to a class, it doesn't really belong in that class itself, but it may for instance belong current source file
 - future: use it when we wanna use asynchronous, and we need use async await when we make instance of this future
 - stream: is a pipe of data that either successful(complete) or err or (never complete), stream of data never complete is like time coz it just continously going forward, stream is like a future just continue its working continusly, and we use await for to get it result
 - generators: 
 - generics: to avoid re-writing code, like we can give any argument to the instance and dart will decide the type of their data automatically

CHAPTER 11
 firebase cli
 - when we integrate our project with firebase, we need to create a firebase project on something called firebase console 

CHAPTER 12 
 - this chapter explain about widget like Columns, Text, FutureBuilder, TextField, Container, AppBar, TextContent
 - stateless :  it can't contain mutable information
 - stateful : something we can see on screen and it can contain information that can be changes as the user interact with it
 - scaffold : like basic building structure that kind of makes a presentable to user
 - make password text field secure : obscureText: true,enableSuggestions: false,autocorrect: false
 - firebase needs initialization before other calls to firebase, we also need to enabling widget binding before Firebase.initializaApp, (read doc)
 - FutureBuilder : it takes and perform the future, once succed or rejected, it will give callback that ask us to produce a widget that will displays to the user depending on state.

CHAPTER 13

CHAPTER 14
- email verification is important coz when someone registers using our email, then we register after that with our original email, in result, our email has been taken we can't use our email to registered to app, it can be a big problem.
